Once a link is broken or damaged usually due to heat, wear and tear over the years, chemical over processing or over manipulation with hair styles, hair breakage occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Porosity assesses how easily the hair accepts and releases moisture and the products and treatments you give it.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When your hair cuticle becomes damaged and is no longer tightly aligned, it will fail to provide proper coverage to the hair shaft and as a result your hair will be like a basket used to fetch water. No moisture will be retained!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine the porosity of your hair, there&rsquo;s a quick and easy way to test that will take just ten seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em>Take some shed hair and drop it in a bowl of water. Then watch it either sink or float.</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>If it sinks immediately then your hair is too porous which means it absorbs products and quickly loses the absorbed product to the atmosphere leaving the hair dry and brittle again.</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>If your hair floats, then you have low porosity which means that your hair does not absorb products/moisture easily leaving it also dry and brittle and prone to breakage.</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>If it sinks at a normal rate (between two to four minutes), this is the ideal place to be shows your hair is healthy.</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if your hair is not sinking at a normal rate, what can you do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well your focus should be building the hair cuticle back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These three methods can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em>Keratin, a very important component of the hair that links hair bonds together, needs to be infused in your hair through regular protein treatments and specifically formulated hydrolized protien infused hair products.</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>A porosity controlling hair product can also be essential to ensuring that hair porosity levels are put in place. They come in the form of hair conditioners or daily moisturizers.</em></li>\r\n	<li><em>Finally, eating a well-balanced diet with lots of fresh fruits and raw vegetables can help with this issue. Limit the amount of starches, fatty and processed foods you consume and drink plenty of water, with that your hair porosity should be under full control.</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever tried this simple hair test?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What were the results?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us know in the comments section!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written By&nbsp;<strong>Daboju Ogburu of&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://www.instagram.com/savvychichairbeautyhub/?hl=en\\">Savvy Chic</a></strong></p>\r\n', 'photos/2017-07-10-23-25-19-daboju-2.jpeg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '10-Jul-2017 11:25 pm', '0', '2019-08-20 15:10:18', '7', 'no', '20170710232519', 'yes'),

Keeping up with all of the latest must-read books can quickly turn into an overwhelming endeavor -- finish one, add five more to the pile, and the cycle wears on until its simply too unbearable to pay attention anymore.', '<p>In the last month the surprise engagement of two of Nigeria&rsquo;s top celebrities,&nbsp;<em>Bankole and Adesua1</em>, broke the internet and gave us all a reason to believe in love and marriage again. It also seems to have raised the question of the viability of online dating in Nigeria, West Africa and among other African nations. Online dating is a very popular means of meeting prospective partners in the western world but has been very slow to take root in Africa and African communities in the diaspora. However, over the last few years there has been a rise in the number of successful relationships known to have started online and transitioned to happy marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I would like to share my Top 7 &nbsp;tips for successfully meeting people online. This includes social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, as well as dedicated networking and dating sites like SuruLereLove&trade;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Be open to the idea:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no point going in half-heartedly. It&rsquo;s all or nothing. You have to first of all make yourself comfortable with the idea of meeting someone online. Before you open our DMs, or sign up to that dating site, we recommend that you first make peace with whatever personal barriers would ordinarily prevent you from going through with dating someone who contacts you online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some people it would mean convincing themselves that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the answer &ldquo;we met online!&rdquo; when asked, &ldquo;where did you meet?&rdquo; Some people may feel that online dating is a sign of desperation, and that if they were popular enough, or pretty enough, or just plain GOOD enough, then they would be able to find a date the traditional way. But this is just not true. The world has become a global village, and for the first time in the history of humanity, the potential dating pool for a young man living in Lagos, can realistically include a woman who lives in Nairobi, Helsinki or Mumbai. The limitations once imposed on us by distance, borders, culture and time have been almost completely erased by the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you don&rsquo;t even have to think that far. Only a few decades ago, you could live in Ibadan and there could be someone living in Eket, and even though you both were perfectly matched, you would never meet and never fall in love, simply because you did not have a common social circle or were never in the same place at the same time. Those days are gone. Your social circle could conceptually be the entire globe, and now there is a very good chance that you both could be on the internet at the exact same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Position yourself to find and be found:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So you are at peace with meeting your partner online? Great! Now it&rsquo;s time to position yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some people it can be very simple: Unlock your Twitter, change your Instagram from private. Make your DMs accessible to people who do not follow you. Don&rsquo;t stop there: Follow people you find interesting, accept follow requests, be interesting enough for people to want to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For someone else it might mean signing up to a dating service like SuruLereLove&trade;, creating a profile, answering the personality questions truthfully, and keeping an open mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understand that unlike traditional dating, the online world has only a very small window available for you to create a lasting impression. Determine how you want your&nbsp;<em>DM2</em>&nbsp;or your message or your profile to stand out from the sea of others that are available. Be creative, be witty, and be funny. Be whatever you need to be, but make sure that you remain true to who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is okay to be picky online! If something doesn&rsquo;t sit right, or raises your suspicion, then don&rsquo;t ignore it. As with traditional dating, there is a lot that we are completely in the dark about, when it comes to the personality and intentions of the person we are meeting online. Sometimes all we can go by is our instincts and intuition, and often times that is all we really need! Look out for people who are pushy and are not prepared to give you your space, people who seem &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; and people who are trying to scam or exploit you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your instincts can pick out a person who will not be a good match, long before this fact becomes apparent. Most of us can testify from experience that in hindsight we always seemed to know that that ex who did us bad was going to be no good.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Do your due diligence:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as you would with traditional relationships, due diligence is extremely important if not more important online. Ask questions. Ask them over and over again, until you get a satisfactory answer. Research the person online and offline: Can I find information about this person online? Does their online persona fit with what you observe offline? Do their social media personas match? Who are their friends? How do other people who know them feel about them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meeting people online often means taking their word for who they say they are. Do yourself a favour and go beyond what you are told, or what you can read from their bio or tweets or dating profile. People will always put their best foot forward, (and sometimes that foot is wearing a borrowed shoe).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can take time to cut through the many layers of civility or pretence to get to the real person, but as the Yoruba say, Suru l&rsquo;ere.&nbsp;<em>Patience has its rewards</em>!</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t take rejection to heart:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Meeting people online is not for the overly sensitive. This is because a small percentage of your attempts to communicate with someone online, will probably go unanswered or unacknowledged. Hopefully articles like this will help to change that, as Nigerians, and Africans as a whole, become more open to the idea of online dating. Until then though, be prepared for rejection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are millions of DMs sitting unopened on several phones all across the world tonight. Some people have a few, some have tens, some have hundreds, and you might even have one or two yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s all take a moment to think about the DMs that are on our phones, but have remained unopened. If you are anything like me, you did not ignore them because you were wicked or proud or unkind. You should think about&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;unopened DM, unread WhatsApp message or unacknowledged invitation to connect on SuruLereLove&trade; in the exact same way. It is most likely that they did not ignore you out of malice. There&rsquo;s probably a very good reason why your DM will stay unopened. Dust yourself off and try again. (Preferably somewhere else)</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Be purposeful:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of meeting people online is that there is a staggering amount of variety. The trouble is that if you are not absolutely sure of the exact thing you are looking for, you can come out of the process holding the wrong person&rsquo;s hand. Be intentional: Know what you want. Be purposeful: Set out to achieve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine for yourself what you are looking for on a dating website or app, or what kind of person you would entertain in your DMs and private messages. Create a clear picture in your mind of the things you do not want, and will not accept. This is&nbsp;<em>very important</em>&nbsp;to do even before you open the first DM or get matched with the first date. You&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;know what you&nbsp;<em>want</em>before you discover what is&nbsp;<em>available</em>, if not you may end up choosing based on what you see and not based on what you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, &ldquo;If you go to the market with a pocket full of money and no shopping list, you will return home with two baskets full of items, only to find that you forgot to buy the most important thing!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Protect your safety online:</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important that we put this here. Don&rsquo;t be lured into a false sense of security. Cyberspace can be dangerous. You want to make sure that you are doing everything possible to keep yourself safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a handful of people who see a person&rsquo;s willingness to put themselves out there, as a sign that they are gullible. Prove them wrong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beware of Scammers</em>. Anyone you meet online who asks you to send them money or buy them a gift or make any form of financial transaction is a scammer. Never part with your money. Ever!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beware of Playboys</em>. Ladies watch out. They may never ask you for money. In fact they might be the ones spending it on you. But in the end all they want is your body and are not interested in the rest of you, the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that really matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beware of Gold-diggers</em>. Gentlemen, don&rsquo;t be caught sleeping. Some chicks are out here trying to find love, while some others are trying to make that money. Don&rsquo;t let your emotions get the better of your head. You don&rsquo;t have to spend all your money to prove that you are interested in someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t disclose passwords, don&rsquo;t give out personal details. If you choose to meet in person, make sure you choose a neutral&nbsp;<em>public</em>&nbsp;place. Take a friend with you. Let another friend (or two) know exactly where you are going, and how long you will be gone for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally don&rsquo;t forget to carry&nbsp;<em>vex money3</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olamide and Aisha Craig are the founders of SuruLereLove&trade;,a black owned online dating + matrimonial site that&nbsp;seeks to connect people of African descent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SuruLereLove was created to introduce people and start relationships,&nbsp;and is committed to helping its members find life-long-love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find them on social media @SuruLereLove and online at www.comingsoon.surulerelove.com/signup</p>\r\n', 'photos/2017-07-10-23-43-30-DSC_0148-755x487.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '10-Jul-2017 11:43 pm', '0', '2019-08-20 15:10:18', '22', 'no', '20170710234330', 'no'),

Never mind, My prayer point was for him to return in the first place: If you think praying with your pastor and spending days in church will help solidify your connection,<em>&nbsp;Nne</em>&nbsp;try again! My prayer point was for him to come home and find me and half of that prayer is already answered, so instead of praying in vain, just pray that he will find me and marry me, that way we all win. After all, the shine theory says once one woman wins, we all win.</li>\r\n	<li>If you muttered, she is Igbo he will gravitate towards me because I am yoruba, best believe I have that in my bag as well: My mother speaks fluent yoruba, I have a B.SC in dating yoruba men and I have dated all sorts, &ldquo;the cool calm and collected&rdquo;, &ldquo;the you must respect me&rdquo;, &ldquo;the over obsessed with family values&rdquo;. Think of it, and I met all their family members so I know how to act, behave around a typical or A-typical yoruba family.</li>\r\n	<li>Interstate marriage is the new cool: As an Igbo woman, I already bring variety to the table.
